# Audit Artifacts

This directory stores production audit outputs generated by:

- `npm run audit:api`
- `npm run audit:seo`
- `npm run audit:content`
- `npm run audit:full`

Reports are timestamped and should not be manually edited.

## Severity Rubric

- `critical`: authentication failures, broken protected-route behavior, or hard SEO policy conflicts (for example sitemap/robots contradictions).
- `high`: canonical mismatches, missing page metadata, or preflight/CORS regressions affecting integrations.
- `medium`: wording consistency gaps, duplicate metadata, or route-level UX regressions with clear workaround.
- `low`: cosmetic copy issues, minor spacing/layout polish items, or non-blocking quality warnings.

## Triage SLA

- `critical`: acknowledge within 4 hours, remediate within 24 hours.
- `high`: acknowledge same business day, remediate within 3 business days.
- `medium`: batch in current sprint.
- `low`: track in backlog and close during routine polish.

## Monitoring Flow

- Weekly scheduled workflow: `.github/workflows/weekly-audit.yml`
- Manual trigger: GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`
- Artifacts: uploaded from `docs/audits/` on every run
- Failure handling: open/update `Weekly Production Audit Failure` issue with run link
