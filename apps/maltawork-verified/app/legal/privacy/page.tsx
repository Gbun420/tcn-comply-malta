        Privacy-by-design: the public never sees reviewer identity, raw narratives, or evidence
        files. Evidence is stored in a private vault and is deleted after expiration or moderation
        decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Admin access to evidence is logged. We process notice-and-action and appeals workflows
        consistent with the Digital Services Act (DSA) operational requirements.
